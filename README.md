# Commodity-Price-Forecasting
This project aims to forecast the price of commodity based on Bloomberg data.

The Base Metal contains two kinds of data, base metals from LME and base metals of SHFE. 
Here we find the relationship between inventory and spread, and compare the observed price and implied price. 
All the work is based on historical data yet, but would remain almost same in the futures work.
The plots are direct result of what I have done.

For the future work, I would do follow work:
1. Collect the consumption, production and reserve to estimate the inventory
2. Based on estimated inventory and previous fitted function, forecasting the price and do the same as what have done yet.
3. Expand my work to Energy, precious metals, rare earth and agriculture.
